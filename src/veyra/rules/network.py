"""Network access detection rules.

Flags external downloads and network calls. Higher severity for
download-and-execute patterns and suspicious external domains.

``AS-005`` (raw-IP URLs and URL shorteners) is implemented in
``suspicious_urls.py``. This module re-exports those detectors under their
historical names so existing imports keep working; it must not register a
second copy, or every hit is emitted twice in scan results.
